    Reservoir  Assessment  Tool  (RAT)  is  an  integrated  software  framework  that  consists  of  an 
interactive state-of-the-art web-based visualization system to facilitate  the visualization of 
reservoir monitoring parameters in a near-real-time scale. The tool has been designed to monitor 
the existing reservoirs over Mekong region. The tool facilitates the 
visualization of reservoir states (such as, storage change, inflow, and outflow), which is useful in 
understanding downstream impact. 
  </p>
  <h3 class="fw-bold">Conceptualization of RAT Tool</h3>
  <p class="fs-3 pt-3">
    The RAT frameworks have three main modules â€“Storage Change Module, Data Download
Module and Model Simulation and Post-Processing Module to estimate the reservoir inflow,
outflow, and storage changes. The three modules are run in the backend server and a task
scheduler is used to automate the estimation by setting up task duration.
  </p>
  <h4 class="fw-bold pt-4">1. Storage Change Module</h4>
  <p class="fs-3 pt-3">
    The storage change module, written in a python programming language, is used to produce
reservoir surface area time series. First, it selects a single reservoir from the reservoir database of
the RAT framework. Then it creates a buffer polygon around the reservoir based on the distance
provided. It selects all the available satellite imageries (of a selected sensor) and removes cloud
and cloud shadow using a bit-masking algorithm. After removing the scenes with higher than
threshold cloud cover, it mosaics all the scenes and applies the threshold-based method to create
the water area of the reservoir. Finally, using the area-elevation relationship and the water area
time series, it calculates the storage change for the selected reservoir. The module iterates all the
reservoirs in the same way and generates the reservoir storage change time series for every
reservoir.
  </p>
  <h4 class="fw-bold pt-4">2. Data Download Module</h4>
  <p class="fs-3 pt-3">
    The VIC model requires different types of meteorological parameters like precipitation,
minimum and maximum temperature, wind speed, etc. to run VIC and Routing model to estimate
reservoir inflow. The data download module is developed to download the required data from the
relevant portal and reformat & resample into a specific format to run the VIC simulation model.
  </p>
  <h4 class="fw-bold pt-4">3. Model Simulation and Post-Processing Module</h4>
  <p class="fs-3 pt-3 pb-5">
    This module is used to run the VIC and Route model to get the latest available reservoir inflow
data.
After completing data processing data and calculation, the output will save into PostgreSQL and
it will be accessed by Django and finally, visualize the data in frontend GUI.
