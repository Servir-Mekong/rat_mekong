    Reservoir Assessment Tool (RAT) is an integrated satellite remote sensing-modeling framework with an
interactive state-of-the-art web-based visualization interface to facilitate the visualization of past and
current reservoir state. The tool, originally developed at the University of Washington SASWE Research
Group with support from NASA Applied Sciences Program Additional collaborative support was provided
by University of Houston and SERVIR-Mekong. RAT-Mekong has been designed to monitor the existing
reservoirs over the Mekong region. The tool facilitates the visualization of reservoir states (such as,
storage change, inflow, and outflow), which is useful in understanding downstream impact. 
  </p>
  <p class="fs-4 pt-1 pb-5">
    The founding principle of RAT is to use satellite data of NASA and other agencies to address limitations
faced by stakeholders in regions of limited, absent or inaccessible reservoir operation data. RAT
development has been based on 5 years of research at the University of Washington with extensive
validation in South Asia (80 dams), Southeast Asia (20 dams) and North America (2 dams) (Bonnema et
al. 2016; Bonnema and Hossain, 2017 and Biswas et al., 2021). The development of RAT-Mekong is
always on-going. The developers of RAT-Mekong therefore do not accept any responsibility for wrongful
application or faulty decision making based on RAT-Mekong outputs. Users should read the key
documentation on RAT (see ‘User Guide’) and refer to the main RAT paper by<span><a href="https://saswe.net/publications/RATPaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Biswas et al. (2021)</a></span>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="fs-3 fw-bolder">Conceptualization of RAT-Mekong Tool</h3>
  <p class="fs-4 pt-3">
    The RAT frameworks have three key modules –Storage Change Module, Data Download Module and
Model Simulation and Post-Processing Module to estimate the reservoir inflow, outflow, and storage
changes. The three modules are run in the backend server and a task scheduler is used to automate the
estimation by setting up task duration.
  </p>
  <h4 class="fw-bold pt-4">1. Reservoir Storage Change Module</h4>
  <p class="fs-4 pt-3">
    The reservoir storage change module, written in a python programming language, is used to produce
reservoir surface area time series. First, it selects a single reservoir from the reservoir database of the
RAT framework. Then it creates a buffer polygon around the reservoir based on the distance provided. In
the current version of RAT-Mekong, only visible (optical) satellite imageries are used with adjustments
for cloud cover and cloud shadow using a bit-masking algorithm. After removing the scenes with higher
than threshold cloud cover, the reservoir storage change module mosaics all the scenes and applies the
threshold-based method to create the water area of the reservoir. Finally, using the area-elevation
relationship for a reservoir and the water area time series calculated from satellite imageries, the
module calculates the storage change for the selected reservoir. The module iterates all the reservoirs in
the same way and generates the reservoir storage change time series for every reservoir. It should be
noted that in an effort to continually improve accuracy and sampling, a future version of RAT-Mekong is
likely to incorporate the use of data from multiple sensors in the optical (Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS) and
microwave (Sentinel-1, Jason-3, Sentinel-6) wavelengths.
  </p>
  <h4 class="fw-bold pt-4">2. Data Download Module</h4>
  <p class="fs-4 pt-3">
    In the current version of RAT-Mekong, the hydrologic model used for simulating reservoir inflow is the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model.  VIC requires different types of meteorological parameters like precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature, wind speed, etc. to run VIC and Routing model to estimate reservoir inflow. The data download module is developed to download the required data from the relevant portal and reformat & resample into a specific format to run the VIC simulation model.
  </p>
  <h4 class="fw-bold pt-4">3. Model Simulation and Post-Processing Module</h4>
  <p class="fs-4 pt-3 pb-5">
    This module is used to run the VIC and Route model to get the latest available reservoir inflow
data.
After completing data processing data and calculation, the output will save into text (.txt) file format and
it will be accessed by Django and finally, visualize the data in frontend GUI.
